# planets-template
A copy of the planets repository for students to use in the collaboration exercise. 

To start this lesson, you will import a copy of Drew's repository called `planets-template` 
into a repository in your account called `planets`. 
Below I assume that your user ID is `yourusername`. You need to replace
`yourusername` with your actual github username.

1.  Go to [GitHub's importer][import].

2.  Click on "Check the URL".  (GitHub won't import until you've done this.)

3.  Select the owner for your new repository.
    In our example this is `yourfilename`.

4.  Choose a name for your lesson repository.
    In our example, this is `planets`.

5.  Make sure the repository is public.

6.  At this point, you should have a page like this:

    ![](img/using-github-import.png)

    You can now click "Begin Import".
    When the process is done,
    you can click "Continue to repository" to visit your newly-created repository.

7.  Clone your newly-created repository to your desktop:

    ~~~
    $ git clone https://github.com/yourfilename/planets.git
    ~~~

    Note that the URL for your lesson will be different than the one above.

8.  Go into that directory using:

    ~~~
    $ cd planets
    ~~~
